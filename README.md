### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I turn raw datasets into impactful insights through cutting-edge analytics.

My skills allow me to not only visualize and tell compelling data stories, but also build advanced machine learning models for enhanced predictions. I breathe life into numbers - letting the data speak for itself and guide smarter decisions.

Currently I leverage **SQL, Python, Power BI** and more as a Reinsurance Data Analyst in optimizing complex workflows, but I'm always expanding my analytics toolkit through self-driven projects focusing on E-commerce, Finance, and Meteorology.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Computer Vision** (Face Detection).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Selenium** & **Natural Language Processing**.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Job Transition from **Data Analyst** to **Data Scientist**.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **Power BI**, **VBA**, or **Process Automations**
